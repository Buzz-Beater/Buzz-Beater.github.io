  summary: >
    Hi! I'm Baoxiong, a first year Ph.D. student in [VCLA@UCLA](http://vcla.stat.ucla.edu/) advised by [Prof. Song-chun Zhu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~sczhu/).
    Before coming to LA and obtaining my M.S. of Computer Science in 2019, I got my B.S. from Peking University in 2018 where I spent three wonderful years in the computer science department
    of EECS and PKU Operating System Lab. My research interest lies in computer vision, artificial intelligence and cognitive science, especially about human activity understanding, task planning and intention modeling/prediction. You can find my CV [here](/assets/pdf/cv.pdf).
