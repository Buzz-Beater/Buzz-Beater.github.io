  summary: >
    Hi! I'm Baoxiong, a senior undergraduate in the [Computer Science Department](http://eecs.pku.edu.cn/EN/) at Peking Univeristy. I'm currently enrolled in the integrated BS/MS program held by PKU and UCLA. I'm also doing research on computer vision at [Center for Vision, Cognition, Learning, and Autonomy (VCLA)](http://vcla.stat.ucla.edu/) advised by [Prof. Song-chun Zhu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~sczhu/).
    My research interests lie in computer vision and cognitive science, especially about human action understanding and intention prediction in multi-agent scenarios.
