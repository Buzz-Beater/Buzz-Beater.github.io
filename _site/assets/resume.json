He has earned degrees from the University of Oklahoma and Stanford. (Go Sooners and Cardinals!) Before starting Pied Piper, he worked for Hooli as a part time software developer. While his work focuses on applied information theory, mostly optimizing lossless compression schema of both the length-limited and adaptive variants, his non-work interests range widely, everything from quantum computing to chaos theory. He could tell you about it, but THAT would NOT be a “length-limited” conversation!

An attributed spatial And-Or graph (S-AOG) is proposed to represent indoor scenes. The S-AOG is a probabilistic grammar model, in which the terminal nodes are object entities including room, furniture, and supported objects. Human contexts as contextual relations are encoded by Markov Random Fields (MRF) on the terminal nodes. We learn the distributions from an indoor scene dataset and sample new layouts using Monte Carlo Markov Chain. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can robustly sample a large variety of realistic room layouts based on three criteria: (i) visual realism comparing to a state-of-the-art room arrangement method, (ii) accuracy of the affordance maps with respect to ground-truth, and (ii) the functionality and naturalness of synthesized rooms evaluated by human subjects.","code":"https://github.com/SiyuanQi/human-centric-scene-synthesis","paper":"http://www.yzhu.io/projects/cvpr18_scenesynthesis/scenesynthesis_cvpr18.pdf","supplementary":"http://www.yzhu.io/projects/cvpr18_scenesynthesis/scenesynthesis_supplementary_cvpr18.pdf","img":"/assets/img/me.jpg","authors":[{"name":"Baoxiong Jia","isme":1},{"name":"Siyuan Huang"},{"name":"Chenfanfu Jiang","website":"http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cffjiang/"},{"name":"Song-chun Zhu","website":"http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~sczhu/"}]},{"name":"Hello World","conference":"CVPR"}],"references":[{"name":"Erlich Bachman","reference":"It is my pleasure to recommend Richard, his performance working as a consultant for Main St. Company proved that he will be a valuable addition to any company.\n"}]}
